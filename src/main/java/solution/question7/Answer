Which design pattern would you use in the following situation?

Question:
We want to define an interface for creating different types of Vehicle-s;
we have several subclasses of Vehicle such as a Truck and a Plane, and plan to add more subclasses in the future.
We want to  let subclasses decide the object of which class to return.

Answer: Factory Method Design Pattern.
It has an interface that creates different types of objects and subclasses implement this
method to return an object of a subclass as needed.
